# TraceDNS
TraceDNS is a multi-source OSINT subdomain enumeration tool designed to map a domain’s attack surface using both local recon tools and passive intelligence APIs. It aggregates results from providers like crt.sh, SecurityTrails, VirusTotal, Shodan, and local tools such as Amass and Subfinder, then deduplicates and exports clean, actionable results.
